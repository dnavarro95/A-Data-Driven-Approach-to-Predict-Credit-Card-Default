# A-Data-Driven-Approach-to-Predict-Credit-Card-Default

The purpose of this project was to apply data mining techniques to predict whether a new credit card holder will default on his/her credit card or not, based on several attributes and a period of usage. 
This capability would allow banks and other financial institutions to assess risk more effectively and to rely on a data driven approach for better decision making. 
As credit card usage has become ubiquitous in consumption payments and transactions, analyzing card holderâ€™s default becomes crucial for banks.
This project explored the relationships between different customer attributes that lead to default.

This project was conducted by Nicolas Navarro, and Hazem Sharaf as part of the graduate level course CS5525 Data Analytics at Virginia Tech.
